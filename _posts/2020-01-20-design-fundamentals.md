## What is User Research?

User research there is to help answer three big questions: what do people need, what do people want, can they use the thing that we're working on.

## Learn about Market Demand and Trends

1. Keyword Evaluation (Google AdWords)

   What are people searching for? What do you notice after filtering the high volume keywords?

2. Content Competition (Google Search)

   What type of content appears in your searches? (articles or companies) Is this consistent for other keyword searches related to your idea?

3. Geographic Validation (Google Trends)

   Where do people live who are searching for related keywords? What barriers might exist to deliver the product or service?

4. Social Media Validation (Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest)

   What volume of people use keywords related to your idea? How are users talking about related ideas? Handy for communicating your idea and for marketing materials later.

## Know What You're Up Against

Your idea may be original but it's more likely that your idea is similar to ones that have come before it.

WHOis.net, SilimarWeb, Twitter, Facebook can give you imformation about your competitors.

## How to Refine the Idea

1. Twitter description

   how would you announce your product in a 140 characters, or less?

2. future press release

   how would your product first apper in the news?

3. one page executive summary

   What is the product called?, Who are the users and how many of these users exist?, What problem does the product solve and how valuable is the solution to users?, How does the product solve the problem and what does the solution look like?, Why is your approach durably different than the competition?, When it will ship and what are the major milestones?

HOW TO:

1. Introduce activity
2. Ask people to work in groups and create their own version of the tweet
3. Share, compare, and select the best
4. Digitize.

## User Experience Design

The study of users and their particular contexts in order to design tools so that users can perform tasks with the tools to achieve their goals.

## Interaction Design and Tasks

breaking product down into tasks, subtasks, and associated featrues can help you prototype and work toward a minimum viable product.

## Design Flows and User Testing

Imagin the screens that the user's going to interact with actually look like. And then look for connections among these screens. It starts to guide you how overall navigation of user experience is going to work.

## Material Design

Things that can move in predictable ways that feel tactile and feel familiar to the user.

## Accessible Design

Accessible: usable by all people regardless if they have a disability.

## Personas and User Flows

Lay out persona with four quadrants.

| Sketch, Name                | Pain Points, Needs |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Demographic Info, Behaviors | Solutions          |

## Common Design Elements

Below are some common terms that you'll encounter when discussing the design of webpages and apps. 

1. copy

   Refers to written material included in your product (in contrast to photographs or other elements of layout).

2. headline

   Words that communicate what the company or product does; different headlines will work for different products and user goals; choose wisely.

   resource: [The Ultimate Home Page Headline](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/ultimate-home-page-headline/)

3. tagline

   Taglines contain phrases that explain the key benefits and purpose of your product. Taglines are critical because people scan websites, especially first time visitors who are just beginning to understand your product.

   resource: [Creating a Memorable Headline/Tagline: 20 Great Examples](http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/20-great-headline-copy/)

4. value proposition

   A promise of value to be delivered and acknowledged. A belief from the customer that value will be delivered and experienced. A value proposition can apply to an entire organization, or parts thereof, or customer accounts, or products or services.

5. below the fold

   The content area of a screen that is not visible without scrolling; many website home pages contain additional content "below the fold".

6. call to action (CTA)

   An instruction to the audience to provoke an immediate response, usually using an imperative verb such as "call now", "sign up", "buy now", or "visit a store today"; these often take the form of buttons.

## Homepage Design

Homepages should answer these questions: what is this?, what is being offered?, what can I do here?, How do I start?

All of these information should be present, but you should also be careful not to overhelm your users. You can link to other pages for users to learn more about your product or services. Put those links in the footer.

## Forms

Signup and payment forms require you to get and verify information from the user. There's lots of advice for creating forms, and we've curated some of the best resources and examples from existing products and the web.

1. Keep it simple. 

   Users are more likely to complete forms, signup, and pay, when those forms are easy and intuitive. Clear descriptions, vertical layouts, pre-populated forms, examples, and clear calls to action can help users make sense of the form and make them more willing to spend the time to fill them out. This also means that you should only ask for as much information as you need.

2. Validate user input and provide feedback. 

   Next, you can increase the chance that users succeed by designing forms by checking what user's type and by providing corrective feedback, examples, and even suggestions. Is the user's phone number in the correct format? Did the user choose a username that is already taken? Does the form verify input after the user finishes typing in each box? These are essential features of your form that can drive up the number of successful users.

3. Always test your forms. 

   You can test the form yourself. Some teams have done this by a role play between a user and a browser. The browser can only respond with the copy on the page. Is the form easy to complete? Are formatting options clear? Did the user get stuck, frustrated, or lost?

#### Why Details Matter in Payments: Conversions! ;

[The $300 Million Button](http://www.uie.com/articles/three_hund_million_button/) On BestBuy.com, the small change of allowing people to skip sign-up during checkout resulted in $300 million extra revenue per year.

[Double Conversion Rates with Optional Fields](http://analyticsexpert.net/blog/2010/05/28/change-one-word-double-your-conversion-rate/) ClickTale doubled their sign-up conversions from 40% to 80% with a simple change of adding an explicit and very visible “optional” label to the phone number input box.
